Does anyone know if a list of known (and working) 
Maven Central Repository (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/) mirrors?

If not, what mirrors do you use when the central repository is down?
The official Maven 2 repository is at:

https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ hosted in the US, or
http://uk.maven.org/maven2 hosted in the UK.
