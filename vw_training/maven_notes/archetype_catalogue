Location of catalog files
The Archetype Plugin knows by default about its internal catalog. It also knows about the local and remote catalogs.

local represents the ~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml catalog file.

remote represents the https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml catalog file.

How does the Archetype Plugin know about archetypes?
Knowledge about archetypes is stored in catalogs.

The catalogs are xml files: see the reference documentation.

The Archetype Plugin comes bundled with an internal catalog. This one is used by default.

The Archetype Plugin can use catalogs from local filesystem and from HTTP connections.
