What Maven goals should I write?
Maven Goals:-
compiler:compile – the compile goal from the compiler plugin is bound to the compile phase.
compiler:testCompile is bound to the test-compile phase.
surefire:test is bound to the test phase.
install:install is bound to the install phase.
jar:jar and war:war is bound to the package phase.

What are all the Maven goals?
Maven Build Phases
validate.
compile.
test.
package.

Role of POM in Build Lifecycle
The maven builds executed through the command line runs a set of phases and goals. 
The pom.xml configuration plays a major role in setting up the project build lifecycle. 
The packaging value of pom.xml file defines the set of goals to be executed by the maven build. 
For example, if it’s jar then the following phases and goals will be executed.

Phase						Goal
process-resources			resources:resources
compile						compiler:compile
process-test-resources		resources:testResources
test-compile				compiler:testCompile
test						surefire:test
package						jar:jar
install						install:install
deploy						deploy:deploy

We can also configure goals in the pom.xml file using the plugins element. 
This is mostly required when you have created a custom plugin and want to execute any specific goal for a build phase.
