Document Object Model

The document object represents the whole html document.

When html document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a document object. 
It is the root element that represents the html document. It has properties and methods. 
By the help of document object, we can add dynamic content to our web page.

As mentioned earlier, it is the object of window. So window.document Is same as document  

According to W3C - "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface 
that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
